<!-- Animation Challenge
-------------------

Your task is to create two animations that will first cause
 the background to fade in and expand in width from left to 
 right, then fade in the text in the center. The first 
 animation should take 1.5 seconds, followed by a 0.5 second
  delay, and finally, 1 second for the text fade-in. Both 
  animations should have an ease-out timing function and run
   once. All styles should be retained once the animation
    ends. Good luck! -->
